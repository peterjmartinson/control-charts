# Literary Control Charts
[Control charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_chart) are typically used to evaluate the performance of some process over time.  However, they can also be effectively used to indicate changes of mood in a short story.

This project demonstrates the use of control charts in analyzing short stories, using as an example Washington Irving's _The Legend of Sleepy Hollow_.

The text of the story was lifted from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41).  The body of the story was initially processed manually using a simple text editor (Vim).  Then, the individual paragraphs were analyzed using Excel.  Finally, the control charts themselves were built using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

The raw story can be found [here](https://github.com/peterjmartinson/control-charts/blob/master/Texts/SleepyHollow.txt).

The Excel breakdown can be found [here](https://github.com/peterjmartinson/control-charts/blob/master/Spreadsheets/SleepyHollowPData.xlsx).

The Jupyter notebook showing the creation of the actual control charts can be found [here](https://github.com/peterjmartinson/control-charts/blob/master/Notebooks/SleepyHollow_Analysis.ipynb).

A final PowerPoint presentation of the control chart can be found [here](https://github.com/peterjmartinson/control-charts/blob/master/Martinson_ControlCharts.pptx).
